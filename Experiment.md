## Experiment Data

- Experiment videos with GPS of five observers is made publicly available and hosted on AWS S3 (Asia-Pacific, Tokyo) bucket.

- All observers' video and GPS are provided separately for convenience.

- You require some processing on how to associate GPS logs to the video files. All video files have timestamp laid on top for verification.
